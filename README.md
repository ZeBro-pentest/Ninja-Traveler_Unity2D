# 2D Adventure Game â€” Diploma Project

This 2D game became my diploma project because I spent a lot of time searching for suitable images and characters, as well as developing animations and player scripts. Although this game is my diploma work, it is still unfinished and has not been tested even halfway.

## Genre
Adventure

## Story
The player receives a mission from the sensei: to complete the game and return the stolen katana.  
The game is planned to have 5 episodes, each ending with a boss fight required to progress through the chapter.  
After the final battle, the ninja returns to the sensei and hands over the katana.

## Note
The **Exit** button does not work yet. :)
